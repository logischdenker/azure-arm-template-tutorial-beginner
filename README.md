# Azure ARM Templates Tutorial
This repo is intended to be used as hands on lab for creating Azure ARM templates on a beginner level.

Work your way through each folder to master the Azure ARM templates ;)

In the sub folders you will find the `template.json` and the `template-final.json` files where as the `template.json` is intended to be used as working file for you and the `template-final.json` is just for reference.

Try things out and mess around with the JSON files!

## Prerequisites
Make use of Visual Studio Code to follow along this lab!

To get support writing your JSON template install the `msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools` extension and also the `ms-vscode.powershell` extension to write and debug Powershell scripts within VS Code.

For the Powershell part you need to have the latest [Azure RM Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-5.5.0) installed.

Is it worth mentioning you also need an Azure subscription to deploy your template to?!?

## DISCLAIMER
This repo is beeing used by me to guide people through their first steps with using ARM templates and make their Azure infrastructure reusable. There are many more ways to make use of Azure ARM templates than I can imagine. So this is just my way of dealing with the ARM templates...
